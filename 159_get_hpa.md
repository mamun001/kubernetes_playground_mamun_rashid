### kubectl get hpa -A



#### What is HPA? (From Official Documentation)

####  The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler changes the shape of your Kubernetes workload by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of Pods in response to the workload's CPU or 
      memory consumption, or in response to custom metrics reported from within Kubernetes or external metrics from sources outside of your cluster.
